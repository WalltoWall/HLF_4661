# News Post

The News Post custom type represents a news article. News Posts are managed in
Prismic using two tabs: Main and Body.

- **Main**: Information about the page such as its title and URL.
- **Body**: Page content such as images and text.

All pages within the website start with the main header and end with the main
footer. All content on the page is designed to be responsive to work on both
mobile and desktop devices.
