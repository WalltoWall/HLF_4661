# Project

The Project custom type represents an Omidyar Fellows project. Projects
are managed in Prismic using two tabs: Main and Body.

- **Main**: Information about the page such as its title and URL.
- **Body**: Page content such as images and text.

All pages within the website start with the main header and end with the main
footer. All content on the page is designed to be responsive to work on both
mobile and desktop devices.

**Sidebar**: Content from the **Projects** page (a Page that has the UID
`projects`) is used for all project pages' sidebar. The heading and description
that appear in the sidebar for project pages can be edited from the
**Projects** page.
