# Navigation

The Navigation custom type represents groups of pages used to navigate the site.
This includes navigation lists displayed in the header and footer.

The Omidyar Fellows site uses three navigation documents to manage links:

- **Primary**: Used as the main navigation displayed in the site's header and footer.
- **Secondary**: Used as the smaller, less prominent navigation displayed in the site's header.
- **Footer**: Displayed in the footer next to the site's copyright.

Do not delete these documents. Adding new Navigation documents will not affect the site and is not recommended. You can, however, edit those three documents as needed.

<Storybook.CustomTypeFieldsTable
  customTypeId="navigation"
  tab="Main"
  overrides={{
    main: { hide: true }
  }}
/>

## Slices
<br/>

### Nav Item

A Nav Item Slice represents a link in the navigation list. It can have child
links that are displayed in a dropdown.

#### Fields

<Storybook.SliceFieldsTable
  customTypeId="navigation"
  sliceZoneId="main"
  sliceId="nav_item"
  fieldset="non-repeat"
/>

#### Repeatable fields

Each item represents an child link.

<Storybook.SliceFieldsTable
  customTypeId="navigation"
  sliceZoneId="main"
  sliceId="nav_item"
  fieldset="repeat"
/>
