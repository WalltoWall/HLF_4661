# Interior Page

The Interior Page custom type represents a page on the site with a templated
design including a sidebar. Interior Pages are managed in Prismic using three
tabs: Main, Header, and Body.

- **Main**: Information about the page such as its title and URL.
- **Header**: Heading page content such as heroes.
- **Body**: Page content such as images and text.

All pages within the website start with the main header and end with the main
footer. All content on the page is designed to be responsive to work on both
mobile and desktop devices.
