# Adding Projects

How to add new projects.

## Types of news articles

At the time of writing, the Omidyar Fellows website classifies projects as one
of the following types:

- **Summaries**: Short summary of the project with a link to the project's
  website, if available.
- **Interviews**: Short summary of the project and an interview transcript.
- **Case Studies**: Short summary of the project and a longer, more detailed
  case study about the project.

All three types are created the same way in Prismic and only differ in the set
of Slices used.

Projects can have any number of Project Categories, including none or more than
one. Project Category pages will list projects that have been assigned the
category.

## Summaries

**Recommended Slices**: None. The Project's `description` field will be
displayed on the Project's dedicated page.

## Interviews

**Recommended Slices**:
1. **Text Intro**: Short 1-2 sentence introduction to the project.
