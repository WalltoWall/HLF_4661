# Adding Cohorts

How to add new cohorts and their Fellows.

## Working in a release

Before going into cohort and Fellow-specific instructions, let's first go over
how to work in a Release. Prismic's Releases feature allows editors to create,
edit, and delete content from multiple documents in a combined draft. Once
everything is ready to publish, all the changes can be submitted at once.

This is helpful when adding new cohorts since publishing content to the site is
time-sensitive. Cohort and Fellow information can be added to the site ahead of
the public announcement and even scheduled to automatically publish at a
certain date and time.

Learn more about Prismic Releases from Prismic' official documentation here:
[What is a
release?](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/778358-what-is-a-release)

The following instructions assume you will work in a release. You are, however,
free to edit and publish documents are normal without a release if the content
is not time-sensitive.

## Instructions

<br/>

### 1. Create a new release

First, create a new release.

1. In Prismic, click the **Planned** tab at the top of the page, next to **Work**.

2. Click the **Create a new release** button.

3. Enter a short, descriptive name and click the Create button. The name can be
   something like "Cohort X Announcement".

4. Leave the Release by clicking the **Work** tab at the top of the page. You
   can now make document changes and apply them to the newly created Release.

### 2. Create a new cohort

Next, create a new cohort.

1. Click the green **Create new** button (may also appear as a pencil icon) to
   create a new document.

2. Select Cohort in the document type list.

3. Fill out the fields for the document. UID can be left as the default (e.g.
   `cohort-x`).

4. Save the document by clicking the **Save** button.

5. Add the document to the release by clicking the **Publish** button.

6. In the modal that appears, change **Publish it now** to **Publish it during
   a release**.

7. Select the Release created previously.

8. Click **Add to release**.

9. Leave the document by clicking the Left Arrow button.

### 3. Add Fellows

Next, create a Fellow document for each Fellow.

Perform the same steps as **Create a new cohort**, but select the **Fellow**
document type instead. Be sure to fill out all fields correctly and publish to
the Release.

### 4. Publish the release

Once all Fellows have been drafted, publish the release once the cohort
announcement is public.

1. Navigate to the Release by clicking the **Planned** tab at the top of the
   page, next to **Work**, and select the Release. The Release may already be
   selected, in which case the "Planned" button will already be labeled with
   the Release's name.

2. In the right sidebar, click the **Publish now** button, then **Publish now**
   again to confirm.

All the documents will be published at once. Netlify will rebuild the site and
make the changes public in a few minutes.

#### Schedule automatic publication

You can choose to have the release automatically publish at a given date and
time. If you know a specific time the cohort will be announced, this is the
easiest method to ensure the website is updated at the same time.

When publishing the release, click the **Schedule** button instead of **Publish
now**. You can then set a date and time where Prismic will automatically
publish the release.
