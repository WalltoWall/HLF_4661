# Adding News Articles

How to add news articles.

## Types of news articles

At the time of writing, the Omidyar Fellows website classifies news articles as
one of the following types:

- **News**: Coverage of Omidyar Fellows or individual Fellows by the media.
  Includes a summary of external articles with a link to the full story.
- **Opinions**: Opinion pieces by Fellows covered in the media. Like News,
  these include a summary of external articles with a link to the full story.
- **Press Releases**: Items written by Hawaii Leadership Forum about Omidyar
  Fellows and available in full on the Omidyar Fellows site.

All three types are created the same way in Prismic and only differ in the News
Category applied and the set of Slices used.
