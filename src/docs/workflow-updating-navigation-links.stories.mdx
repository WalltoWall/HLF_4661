# Updating Navigation Links

How to add, remove, or change header and footer navigation links.

## Editing the header's navigation

Links in the header are managed using two documents:

- **Primary**: Used as the main navigation displayed in the site's header and
  footer.
- **Secondary**: Used as the smaller, less prominent navigation displayed in
  the site's header.

Changing the names and URLs of these links will automatically update the
header, footer, and mobile navigation menus.

## Editing the footer's navigation

Links in the footer are managed using two documents:

- **Primary**: Used as the main navigation displayed in the site's header and
  footer.
- **Footer**: Displayed in the footer next to the site's copyright.

Changing the names and URLs of these links will automatically update the
header, footer, and mobile navigation menus.

## Creating new navigation lists

Navigation is only managed through the three navigation documents listed above.
Creating a new Navigation document will not have any effect on the site.
